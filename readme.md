> ## Inspiration
> 
>>The day this project was assigned, the world lost a spunky corgi named Gumbo, who passed away unexpectedly. This retro-style game was created in his memory. 

>## Process
>The timeframe on the project was two weeks. The design and code were finished within one week. The additional week was used to improve animation, debug, and add additional features such as sound and game controls.

## Audio 

Audio was added to augment user experience. A toggle button was added to the menu to control audio playback. An original composition, "Gumbo's Song", was created specifically for the game and rendered in GarageBand 10.4.5.
